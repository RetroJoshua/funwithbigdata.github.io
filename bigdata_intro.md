## Introduction to Big Data

Big data is a data high in volume, velocity, veracity, variety, valence and value so that traditional systems cannot be able to process.

Big dataÂ is a collection of large datasets that cannot be processed using traditional computing techniques.

### what launched Big data era ?


- It would cost Rs.12.5 L to store entire spotify library

- By 2021 14.91 mobile devices are available in the world.(S.O'Dea, Feb 28,2020)

- APR 2020 3.81 billion active social media users around the world(Source: KEPIOS ANALYSIS)

- 99% Social media users accessing via mobile (Source: KEPIOS ANALYSIS)

- Big data market is expected 64 billion US dollars in 2021(Source: Statista)

- Due to computing anytime and anywhere(cloud computing)

- Computing anytime and anywhere + data torrent = dynamic and scalable data analysis

### How big data is generating ?

#### Machine generated data :

Machine data is the largest source of Big Data.

- Half tera byte data will be generated for one plane for one trip.

- In real world we use so many sensors, satelite images, Bio-Informatics, Recording etc,.

- IOT devices fueld the bigdata.

```markdown
Increasing number of machines that sense * Data collected by each device = Machines -> Biggest source
```

**Why machine generated data is useful ?**

- Real time problem detection with machine generated data(In-Situ processing)

- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) by using remote monitoring / control industrial process.


#### People generated data

- Most of the time people generate unstructured data(e-mails,photos,videos,music)

- Due to unstructuredness traditional databases/relational databases cannot process human generated data.

- By using big data tools like hadoop, apache strom, apache spark process human generated data.


#### Organization generated data:

- Organizations produces data from commercial transactions, Government open data, Banking/Stock Records, E-commerce, Credit cards, Medical Records

- Better predictions are possible by integrating transaction data, Open data, and analytics.

- Data silos within an organization hindereds opportunity generation, unconnected information islands.

- Highly structured data and connected data gives value to organizational data.
